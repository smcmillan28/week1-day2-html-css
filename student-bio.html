        <p>
            My name is Sam McMillan.  I am from Atlanta, GA.  I have been working in logistics for the last seven years for a company called Coyote Logistics, <br>
            and currently hold an operations manager position.  In my free time, I enjoy running, playing music, and watching movies.  I am looking forward to <br>
            learning more about coding and web development so that I can acquire a new set of marketable skills, make a potential career change, and challenge <br> 
            myself with something new.  
        </p>
